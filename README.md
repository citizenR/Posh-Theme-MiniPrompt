# MiniPrompt

## Introduction

Powershell Prompt theme, inspired by Oh-my-posh, removed git status, keeping python venv

## Why?

Why not using oh-my-posh and its themes?

Because It starts too slowly. On my nuc8i7 with nvme ssd, it takes about 600ms, and over 1s on my old 3rd gen intel i5 laptop. Powershell prompts a warning after every startup. MiniPrompt solves this problem, and I don't need to know git status with every strike.

## Usage

Source it
